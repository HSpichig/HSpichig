This is the repository of Hannes Spichiger containing code related to research projects, generally related to the evaluation of location-related digital evidence.


I'm not a programmer, so the quality of the code may vary heavily and have obscure dependencies that break when you look too sternly at them.

You can find me on twitter (@Protontyp) or send me an email (hspichig@proton.me)
